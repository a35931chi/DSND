Concepts in Experiment Design

I like the casual feel of this section; however, I also feel this section lacks practicality. I know the quizes are coming, but quizes just verify an overall understanding, not the nitty gritty. I've been to interviews where the interviewer asked me about experiment designs and wanted me to walk through an example from the beginning to the end. Therefore, I feel that other than talking about the concepts, the DSND content should also be technical oriented. For example, walk through an experiment with hypotheticals, relate to the concepts mentioned, including the user funnel, unit of diversion, the invariant, KPI, etc, use some statiscal tools such as T-test, or even better, code some stuff in a jupyter notebook. The notebook can also demonstrate the experimental validities (construct, internal, external), bias, .
