Review Lesson 2 - Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) - coming July 25th:
I think generally it's a good idea to go over regex. it's used couple times in these exercises, and widely in NLP.

csv exercise is missing the later half of the content. needed to go to the solution to find the later half.
in exercise cleaning data, instruction wanted us to create a new column name 'Country Name'. should be 'Official Country Name' because it's inconsistent with actual code
same exercise, the dictionary 'dictionary' is not defined. should be country_not_found_mapping instead
in exercise: matching encodings, there's no mystery.csv: FileNotFoundError: File b'mystery.csv' does not exist
in exercise duplicated data exercise, the comment April 4th, 1992 is incorrect. should be April 27th, 1992.
in the same cell, countryname is missing a front quote
in the dummy variables exercise, some explanation was very confusing, especially the part we are using re to create a new variable containing categories. 
in the outliers exercise, there's no inline statement or import matplotlib & plt.show
